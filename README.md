# FlixSphere
FlixSphere - A Movie & Series Hub ðŸŽ¬
FlixSphere is a dynamic, single-page web application designed for browsing a curated collection of movies, TV series, and anime. Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, it offers a seamless and interactive user experience without page reloads.

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts like client-side routing, state management, and dynamic DOM rendering to create a feature-rich user interface.

âœ¨ Features
Dynamic Media Grid: Browse a responsive grid of titles loaded from a mock data source.

Filtering & Sorting: Easily filter the content by genre and sort by rating or release year.

Pagination: Navigate through the media library with simple next/previous page controls.

Detailed Modal View: Click on any title to open a pop-up modal with its poster, description, rating, and other details.

Mock User Authentication: A simulated login/logout system that provides access to user-specific features.

Personal Watchlist: Logged-in users can add or remove items from their personal watchlist, which is displayed on a dedicated page.

CSS3: For custom styles, including the scrollbar design.

Tailwind CSS: Utilized via a CDN for a modern, utility-first styling approach.
